# INFO201
Welcome to my work from INFO 201 A, Technical Foundations of Informatics! This course introduced the fundamental tools and technologies necessary to transform raw data into information. Throught this class I learned how to write code to work with data. All while developing skills associated with each component of the information lifecycle, including the collection, storage, analysis, and visualization of data. Core competencies underlying this process, including data wrangling, version control, and command line proficiency, are acquired through real-world data-driven challenges.
